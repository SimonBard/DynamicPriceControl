'''
SET5 	SetZ1HeatRequestTemperature 	Set Z1 heat shift or direct heat temperature 	-5 to 5 or 20 to max
SET7 	SetZ2HeatRequestTemperature 	Set Z2 heat shift or direct heat temperature 	-5 to 5 or 20 to max

or better set the whole heating curve:
SET16 	SetCurves 	Set zones heat/cool curves 	JSON document (see below)
{"zone1":{"heat":{"target":{"high":35,"low":25},"outside":{"high":15,"low":-15}},"cool":{"target":{"high":35,"low":25},"outside":{"high":15,"low":-15}}},"zone2":{"heat":{"target":{"high":35,"low":25},"outside":{"high":15,"low":-15}},"cool":{"target":{"high":35,"low":25},"outside":{"high":15,"low":-15}}}}

It can be checked with:
TOP29 	main/Z1_Heat_Curve_Target_High_Temp 	Target temperature at lowest point on the heating curve (째C)
TOP30 	main/Z1_Heat_Curve_Target_Low_Temp 	Target temperature at highest point on the heating curve (째C)
TOP31 	main/Z1_Heat_Curve_Outside_High_Temp 	Lowest outside temperature on the heating curve (째C)
TOP32 	main/Z1_Heat_Curve_Outside_Low_Temp 	Highest outside temperature on the heating curve (째C)

I suggest to just enhance the heating curve by some degrees
